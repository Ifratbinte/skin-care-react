                                <p>If you are running an ecommerce site with a lot of product pages, it can be a full-time job making sure that all the information is accurate. It’s one of the most likely errors that will occur in your online store,
                                    so it opens the door to a lot of customer service issues. For this reason, it’s very important that you stipulate that information can sometimes be inaccurate and change without notice. This section should mention
                                    that despite your best efforts, on-site information might not be up-to-date and that certain information (e.g., prices, product descriptions, stock quantities) may change without notice.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div className="single-terms-text">
                                <h5>2. Terms of sale</h5>
                                <p>This part of your T&C should set out clear terms on how products can be purchased, whether there are any restrictions e.g. the restriction of sale for age-restricted products and services, and what happens in the event
                                    that a product cannot be supplied. HBO’s ecommerce T&C outlines this quite well. Its “Terms of Sale” section mentions that by placing orders on the site, the customers represent that they are of legal age and that
                                    the information they provide is true and accurate. The terms also mention that HBO takes steps to verify customer information prior to accepting and order and that the company has the right to accept, modify, or
                                    decline orders.
                                </p>

                                <h5>3. Payment terms</h5>
                                <p>This is where you will cover any terms relating to the payment of the product/service you sell. This is one of the biggest areas of liability for your business, so you need to make sure that your customers understand
                                    the expectations surrounding online transactions. Because they are an intermediary between the buyer and seller, Etsy has very comprehensive T&C for its site. It establishes the rights and responsibilities of both
                                    the buyer and the seller. It also states that in agreeing to their T&C, the customer is also agreeing to the T&C of third-party services such as PayPal as well.The payment terms section of your site should include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><i className="fa fa-check"></i> Missed/late payment conditions</li>
                                        <li><i className="fa fa-check"></i> How you will handle refunds/returns</li>
                                        <li><i className="fa fa-check"></i> How you will handle payment disputes</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div className="single-terms-text">
                                <h5>4. Shipping & delivery</h5>
                                <p>This is an area that has a lot of potential for error in ecommerce. A delivery could get delayed, damaged in transit — or not arrive at all. This is especially important if you use a 3PL provider or freight company.
                                    This is because your business no longer has direct control over what happens to orders. But the buck stops with you, as far as your customer is concerned. Although this is important for any seller, it has particular
                                    relevance to those who sell products that are more logistically difficult to fulfill. That’s why it’s essential to outline your shipping and delivery terms, in which your discuss the amount of time it takes to fulfill
                                    orders, how costs are calculated and whether extra fees are applicable, and what your level of responsibility includes when third parties are involved.</p>

                                <h5>5. Intellectual property</h5>
                                <p>As an online business, you are more likely to be vulnerable to intellectual property theft in the form of your logo, business name or site theme. For this reason, you need to protect your intellectual property within
                                    your T&C by stating your ownership over such features. An intellectual property clause should act to ensure that brands or trademarks are not misused in any way and clearly state that nothing contained within the
                                    website should be construed as granting any license or the right to use any trademark without the prior written consent of the owner of the website</p>

                                <p>Your website Terms of Use simply sets out the terms for accessing a website and applies to every single visitor. The Terms of Use usually cover items such as privacy and prohibited uses of the website. Starbucks covers
                                    this in the “Acceptable Use” section of its T&C. In it, they state that their site must not be used to harass, abuse, defames, or violate the rights of any other party. The clause also says that Starbucks has the
                                    right to cancel any user’s participation in its sites if it deems that the user violated its terms.</p>
